# simulate-swarming-behaviour
Created a simulation in Python's graphics module (turtle) with classes of creatures and lights. Using basic object oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, I had creatures that were attracted to the lights and creatures that were repelled. In addition, I created an arena class where the objects moved in.
